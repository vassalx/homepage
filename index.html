                  <h2>Résumé</h2>
                  <p>― I'm the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far. Nobody's ever been more
                    successful than me. I'm the most successful person ever to run. Ross Perot isn't successful like me.
                    Romney ― I have a Gucci store that's worth more than Romney. Sorry losers and haters, but my IQ is
                    one of the highest ― and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your
                    fault.</p>

                    other bureaucracy, but program offered courses in real estate, asset management entrepreneurship,
                    and wealth creation. 98% students gave positive reviews while studying, however some of these
                    ungrateful gringos filed lawsuits against Trump University after the course. I had to pay $25
                    million to settle that...</p>

                    building and boosted it from three-star to four-star hotel (I called it "the Mona Lisa" and sold it

                    pay $200K initiation fee (and there is another annual fee for members, it is very expensive to be
                    rich). That year I also opened a casino called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana became a manager, because
                    she is another Trump!</p>

                    filed an antitrust lawsuit against United States Football League, so NJG are not doing so good now,

                    workers to demolish the historic Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features. All this to make
                    architectural critic Paul Goldberger say in 1983 that the tower's atrium is "the most pleasant
                    interior public space to be completed in New York in some years". At the same time I also started a
                    repair job on the Wollman Rink in Central Park and completed the work in three months for $1.95
                    million, which was $775,000 less than the initial budget!</p>
